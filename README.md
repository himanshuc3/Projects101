# Projects101

A jar of web-apps that helped me up and running with web development.
This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt. 

It contains a random collection of small websites using primarily front-end and some of the back-end.
These are not optimized by the help of minimization scripts and tools and therefore could be little bit slow in there operation.

Peace!!
