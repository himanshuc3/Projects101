# Projects101

A jar of web-apps that helped me up and running with web development.
This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt and #100daysofcode. 

It contains a collection of web-apps/websites using primarily front-end languages html5, CSS3 and javascript and their framework such as jQuery, animate.css, AJAX and many more. These are **not optimized** by the help of minimization scripts and tools and therefore could be little bit slow in there operation. 

### The Apps included are:
  * The homepage for the web apps.
  * Hangman
  * Quiz
  * Rock-Paper-Scissors
  * Madlibs
  etc......

Peace!!
