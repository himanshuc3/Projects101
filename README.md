# Projects101

A jar of web-apps that helped me up and running with web development.
This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt and #100daysofcode. 

It contains a collection of web-apps/websites using primarily front-end languages html5, CSS3 and javascript and their framework such as jQuery, animate.css, AJAX and many more. These are **not optimized** by the help of minimization scripts and tools and therefore could be little bit slow in there operation. 

### The Apps included ARE:
  * The homepage for the web apps(Projects101).
  * Sketchpad
  * Hangman
  * Tribute to Pablo Picasso
  * Animate it
  * To-do List
  * Calculator
  * Quote-machine
  * Awesome Quiz
  * Rock-Paper-Scissors
  * Madlibs

Peace!!
